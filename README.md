# Capstone-Project---WanderLust
Shorthand stories are designed to be engaging and immersive for desktop and mobile readers, but do not currently provide an immersive experience for VR users (other than as a plain web page). For this project we would like to experiment with approaches for extending new and existing stories into the immersive VR space via WebXR, to allow authors to create stories that take advantage of the VR platform without requiring custom development or major changes to stories. 
For example, stories could be represented as a sequence of 360-degree views/videos/etc that the viewer can navigate through in a similar fashion to scrolling through the browser. 
Key roles will include software development of the basic immersive system and UI/UX design of the view+navigation.
