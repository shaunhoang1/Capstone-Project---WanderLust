<a-text value="The driver told me that the car was broken and I'm afraid I won't be able to go anywhere tonight. In desperation, I had to rent a hotel to spend the night in this town.
Â I lay in bed staring at the ring in a daze and soon fell into a dream. It was a strange dream. In the dream, I actually swam unimpeded in the deep sea. There was a green stone statue on the seabed. The shape was very similar to the pattern on the ring.
Suddenly, I was awakened by the sound of thunder and rain outside the window. I looked out the window, and a scene I will never forget happened, just as the shopkeeper described, countless half-human, half-fish creatures crawled out of the water and headed towards the town.
