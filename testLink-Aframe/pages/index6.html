<a-text value="The bus soon came to a halt, and I dashed off to attempt to alleviate the discomfort of the journey, but the stink in the air didn't help much. Dilapidated wooden dwellings, a row of houses crammed together without regard for norms, even the town centre is sparsely populated.
With a few hours before the bus left again, I dropped by the local grocery store out of boredom and curiosity, hoping to learn anything valuable. As soon as I stepped in, I was drawn to a golden shimmering ring placed on the store's counter, which seemed out of place in comparison to the rest of the store.
I first asked the shopkeeper for information about the town, but he gave me a very impatient look as if to warn me not to ask any further questions about the topic until I bought the ring, and at the same time he looked at me maliciously.
That ring piqued my interest in an unusual way. It was a gold-bordered ring with a green stone inlay in it. The pattern carved on the stone was bizarre, like a half-human, half-fish monster. I dimly remembered seeing a similar design before. I was unsure about purchasing this ring.
The owner of the shop told me the story of this town with a half-smile. A hundred years ago, this town lived on the port trade. At that time, it was still a vibrant town. However, the good times did not last long. The town was quickly dragged down by the ensuing war. Many people lost their livelihood jobs. It's all ruined.
However, this scene didn't last long when an ship sailed toward the town. The captain told everyone in the town that he knew a true god, and as long as everyone was willing to follow him, Innsmouth would prosper. From then on, the town seemed to come alive, with schools of fish flocking to the town and smoke from the factory chimneys. However, every night the residents of the town mysteriously disappear.
Finally, on a stormy night, the bizarre events are revealed by the half-man, half-fish creatures that keep emerging from the shoreline. It turned out that the captain and his followers were constantly sacrificing residents to those monsters in exchange for various resources. Since then, there have been many mixed species of humans and fish in the town.
Such people don't show obvious features at first, but around the age of 20 they start to lose their hair and gradually become half human and half fish. I hear a chill in my heart here. I subconsciously looked at my watch, it was time to get on the departing bus.
