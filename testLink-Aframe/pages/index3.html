<a-text value="I'm afraid I wouldn't care about any uninteresting urban tales if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes, nor would I recognise this town that I couldn't find on a map. 
The year was 1846, and the weather appeared colder than usual.
I had recently graduated from university and was on my way to the railway station to purchase a train ticket to my hometown to see my grandfather and grandma, whom I hadn't seen in a long time.
However, I was interrupted by an extraordinarily pricey railway ticket.
I remained in front of the ticket office for a long time, staring at the train timetable and hesitating, until the conductor, realising that I had no money, led me to another cheaper and more practicable option: take the bus across the street to Innsmouth.
Then, board the bus from Innsmouth to my final destination.
 Innsmouth is now merely a backwards community that relies on fishing for a living due to a lack of information and access to railways. 
According to folklore, the locals there worship evil gods and will occasionally summon demons from hell to devour passing visitors.
It is not advisable to spend the night there. My concerns about the odd town I was about to see were eased by the conductor's explanation.
